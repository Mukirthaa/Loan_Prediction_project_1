##Project Overview : 
The aim of this project is to predict whether a loan application will be approved or not based on applicant data. 
The dataset includes features such as income, credit history, and loan details.

##Key Features Preprocessing: Handling missing values using imputation. 
                              Scaling numerical features with StandardScaler. 
                              One-hot encoding categorical variables. 
Models Implemented:

Logistic Regression
Random Forest Classifier
Decision Tree Classifier
Gradient Boosting Classifier
